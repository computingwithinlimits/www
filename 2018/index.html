                <h2>About ACM LIMITS 2018</h2>
                <p>The ACM LIMITS workshop aims to foster discussion on the impact of present and future ecological, material, energetic, and societal limits on computing. These topics are seldom discussed in contemporary computing research. A key aim of the workshop is to promote innovative, concrete research, potentially of an interdisciplinary nature, that focuses on technologies, critiques, techniques, and contexts for computing within fundamental economic and ecological limits. A longer-term goal is to build a community around relevant topics and research. We hope to impact society through the design and development of computing systems in the abundant present for use in a future of limits. This year we are colocating for the first time with <a href="http://2018.ict4s.org/">ICT4S</a>.</p>

              <h2>Call For Papers</h2>
              
              <p><strong>The <a href="">submission site</a>
              is now open for submissions; see below for details.</strong></p>
              
              <p>LIMITS aims to foster research on the impact of present or future ecological, material,
              energetic, and/or societal limits on computing and computing research to respond to such
              limits. The medium-term aim of the workshop is to foster concrete research, potentially of
              an interdisciplinary nature, that innovates on technologies, techniques, and contexts for
              computing within fundamental limits. A longer-term goal is to build a community around
              relevant topics and research. A goal of this community is to impact society through the
              design and development of computing systems in the abundant present for use in a future of
              limits and/or scarcity.</p>

              <p>We envision two broad categories of papers: "discussion papers" and
              "systems papers" (see below). Submissions <b>do not</b> need to strictly fit
              into either category. All papers should succinctly frame the limits that are
              of interest to the author(s).</p>

              <p><b>Discussion papers</b> explore the nature of limits and computing. Good discussion
              contributions will detail the nature of the limits of interest, describe their impact on
              computing, and present directions for future research. Relevant topics include, but are
              not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> Sustainability and computing
                <li> Re-evaluation of conventional computing premises (e.g. Moore's law)
                <li> Discussion of new limits and their implications for computing
                <li> Analysis of unnecessary computing
                <li> Analysis of greenwashing in computing
                <li> Ecological economics and/or biophysical economics and computing
                <li> Implications of limits for computing systems for health, education, agriculture, transportation, entertainment, commerce, etc.
              </ul><br>
              <p><b>Systems papers</b> describe the design, implementation, and evaluation
              of computing systems that work within or help cope with limits.  Also of
              interest are evaluations of systems that fail due to limits. Good systems
              contributions will address problems that meet present or future societal
              needs, describe clear limits and operational boundaries, and provide a
              detailed evaluation of the system in question. Relevant topics include, but
              are not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> Material- and manufacturing-constrained computing devices
                <li> Energy- and material-efficient computing and communication
                <li> Wide-area communication under constraints
                <li> Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Interaction Design under constraints
                <li> Evaluation of limits to modern computing systems
                <li> Life-cycle analysis of computing systems under limits
                <li> Computer architecture for constrained computing
                <li> Systems for health, education, agriculture, transportation, entertainment, commerce, etc. under limits
              </ul><br>

				<p><img src="img/borning_sm.jpg" width="250" align="left" style="border:10px solid black"> Alan Borning is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington (although retirement has not yet been entirely successful). His research interests have been in human-computer interaction, value sensitive design, and in object-oriented and constraint programming languages.  In addition to work on <a href="https://seed.uw.edu/">SEED</a>, some example projects include the UrbanSim urban simulation system; OneBusAway, a set of tools that provide real-time transit information; the Living Voters Guide, an experiment in social media and civic engagement; and a series of constraint-based programming languages and systems. He received a BA from Reed College in 1971, and a PhD in computer science from Stanford University in 1979, co-advised by Alan Kay and Terry Winograd. Awards include a Fulbright Senior Scholar Award for lecturing and research in Australia, and being named a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery in 2001.</p>

                <h2>About ACM LIMITS 2017</h2>
                <p>The ACM LIMITS workshop aims to foster discussion on the impact of present and future ecological, material, energetic, and societal limits on computing. These topics are seldom discussed in contemporary computing research. A key aim of the workshop is to promote innovative, concrete research, potentially of an interdisciplinary nature, that focuses on technologies, critiques, techniques, and contexts for computing within fundamental economic and ecological limits. A longer-term goal is to build a community around relevant topics and research. We hope to impact society through the design and development of computing systems in the abundant present for use in a future of limits.</p>

              <p>LIMITS aims to foster research on the impact of present or future ecological, material,
              energetic, and/or societal limits on computing and computing research to respond to such
              limits. The medium-term aim of the workshop is to foster concrete research, potentially of
              an interdisciplinary nature, that innovates on technologies, techniques, and contexts for
              computing within fundamental limits. A longer-term goal is to build a community around
              relevant topics and research. A goal of this community is to impact society through the
              design and development of computing systems in the abundant present for use in a future of
              limits and/or scarcity.</p>

              <p>We envision two broad categories of papers: "discussion papers" and
              "systems papers" (see below). Submissions <b>do not</b> need to strictly fit
              into either category. All papers should succinctly frame the limits that are
              of interest to the author(s).</p>

              <p><b>Discussion papers</b> explore the nature of limits and computing. Good discussion
              contributions will detail the nature of the limits of interest, describe their impact on
              computing, and present directions for future research. Relevant topics include, but are
              not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> Sustainability and computing
                <li> Re-evaluation of conventional computing premises (e.g. Moore's law)
                <li> Discussion of new limits and their implications for computing
                <li> Analysis of unnecessary computing
                <li> Analysis of greenwashing in computing
                <li> Ecological economics and/or biophysical economics and computing
                <li> Implications of limits for computing systems for health, education, agriculture, transportation, entertainment, commerce, etc.
              </ul><br>
              <p><b>Systems papers</b> describe the design, implementation, and evaluation
              of computing systems that work within or help cope with limits.  Also of
              interest are evaluations of systems that fail due to limits. Good systems
              contributions will address problems that meet present or future societal
              needs, describe clear limits and operational boundaries, and provide a
              detailed evaluation of the system in question. Relevant topics include, but
              are not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> Material- and manufacturing-constrained computing devices
                <li> Energy- and material-efficient computing and communication
                <li> Wide-area communication under constraints
                <li> Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Interaction Design under constraints
                <li> Evaluation of limits to modern computing systems
                <li> Life-cycle analysis of computing systems under limits
                <li> Computer architecture for constrained computing
                <li> Systems for health, education, agriculture, transportation, entertainment, commerce, etc. under limits
              </ul><br>

                <h2>Detailed Travel and Local Information</h2>
                <p>The main program begins at Westmont College on the morning of Thursday, June 22.  Therefore, we suggest that you arrive in Santa Barbara sometime on Wednesday, June 21.  Dinner at Westmont on the evening of June 21 is included as well (see below).
                <br><br>
                Travel options include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fly into LAX and <a href="https://www.sbairbus.com/">take the airbus</a>.</li>
                  <li>Fly into SBA and take a taxi or similar service.</li>
                  <li>Take the train to the Amtrak Santa Barbara station, and take a taxi, etc.</li>
                  <li>Drive to Santa Barbara. We will send parking information in a future email.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                We have 25 dorm rooms where you can stay on campus at Westmont.  These rooms are available at no charge to you (included in the registration fee).  Some of these rooms are single-occupancy, and others are double-occupancy, and we believe all have shared bathrooms.  We will do our best to accommodate your request with regard to single vs. double rooms and desired roommates; however, until we have a full response from likely attendees, we cannot guarantee particular accommodations. If you would like to stay in one of those rooms, please email Local Arrangements Chair Don Patterson by May 18, with any details about preferred roommates, etc.  Directions about where to check in and other details will be made available to those staying in the dorms in the next few weeks.
                <br><br>
                You are of course welcome to stay in hotels in and around the Santa Barbara area instead (there are many; see <a href="http://goo.gl/y2fOIk">here</a> for a full listing).  If you choose not to stay on campus, you will be responsible for covering the costs of your accommodations, as well as your transportation to and from Westmont each day.
                <br><br>
                All events will be held at <a href="https://goo.gl/HWqhLl">Winter Hall</a>.  Meals at the Westmont Dining Commons will be included in your registration fee, from dinner on Wednesday night through breakfast on Saturday morning, except dinner on Thursday. There will likely be an optional group dinner outing on Thursday evening as well.
                <br><br>
                The workshop will run through noon on June 24.  We have rooms reserved on campus for the nights of June 21, 22, and 23.  If you wish to stay for the night of June 24, you will need to find alternate accommodations.
                <br><br>
                We also have some (limited) funds to offset some/all of the travel expenses for students and other attendees.  If you would like to be considered for a travel grant, please email Bill Tomlinson <wmt@uci.edu> by May 18, with a brief summary of your likely travel expenses, and a brief statement of need ("I am a graduate student without external funding", etc.).  We will notify all applicants of the outcome shortly thereafter.
                <br><br>
                Information about registration will be made available in the next week or two.
                <br><br>
                We look forward to seeing you all in Santa Barbara!  Please let us know if you have any other questions.
